        <h2>Early Life & Background</h2>
        <p>Born on December 29, 1808, in Raleigh, North Carolina, Andrew Johnson came from a poor family. His father, Jacob, was a laborer, and his mother, Mary McDonough, had a working-class background. After his fatherâ€™s early death, Johnson faced financial struggles and had limited formal education. He was mostly self-taught, with help from his mother and a tailor who took him on as an apprentice. Before entering politics, Johnson became a successful tailor in Greenville, Tennessee, and used his business success to gain local prominence. His experiences with poverty and hardship influenced his populist beliefs, focusing on self-reliance and working-class values.</p>
