        <h2>Challenges During Presidency</h2>
        <p><b>Challenges:</b>
            Johnson faced immense challenges during the Reconstruction period. His lenient policies towards the South after the Civil War led to significant tension with Congress, particularly with Radical Republicans who demanded stricter policies.
            His policies and actions led to his impeachment by the House of Representatives in 1868, though he was acquitted by one vote in the Senate.
            <b>Controversial Moments:</b>
            His vetoes of civil rights legislation and opposition to the Freedmen's Bureau angered many, leading to political battles and the eventual impeachment proceedings.
            Johnsonâ€™s lenient Reconstruction approach alienated many Northern Republicans, making him highly unpopular.
